My elementary middle and high school are all within a 15 mile radius of the University of Tennessee. I've been playing sports since I was six years old, which was a crucial part of my childhood and helped me become who I am today. I'm also a very competitive person. This helped bring a sense of selflessness at a very young age because I was willing to sacrifice anything to win games and reach my desired and result this sense of selflessness would help me in the future. When I became more interested in service clubs, my interest in entering the service groups only increases I would throughout school, by my senior in high school. This interest had turned into passion. I was involved with five service clubs within my school as well as to other in the community. I received most school service principles award, a service to humanities award and other recognitions given to me by my school as well as my community for my efforts and passion in school and community service.
