    "text = '''Hello. My name is Kirsten Freeman. I'm originally from Denver colorado but was raised right here in Knoxville Tennessee. Today I'll be sharing a little bit more about my background, my interest in the holidays and my plans for the future. As I mentioned before, I was raised in Knoxville. My elementary middle and high school are all within a 15 mile radius of the University of Tennessee. I've been playing sports since I was six years old, which was a crucial part of my childhood and helped me become who I am today. I'm also a very competitive person. This helped bring a sense of selflessness at a very young age because I was willing to sacrifice anything to win games and reach my desired and result this sense of selflessness would help me in the future. When I became more interested in service clubs, my interest in entering the service groups only increases I would throughout school, by my senior in high school. This interest had turned into passion. I was involved with five service clubs within my school as well as to other in the community. I received most school service principles award, a service to humanities award and other recognitions given to me by my school as well as my community for my efforts and passion in school and community service. Lastly, I would like to share my plans for the future. I'm a history major with a minor and secondary education. I plan on becoming a history teacher and participating in the teachers for America program, which combines my love of history teaching and helping others. My end goal, however, is to become a high school principal in this position, I would love to remain heavily involved with student life. So today I've shared with you a little bit more about myself, my interest and hobbies and finally, my plans for the future. Thank you.'''"
