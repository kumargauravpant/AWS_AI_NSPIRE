My name is Kirsten Freeman. I'm originally from Denver colorado but was raised right here in Knoxville Tennessee. Today I'll be sharing a little bit more about my background, my interest in the holidays and my plans for the future. As I mentioned before, I was raised in Knoxville. My elementary middle and high school are all within a 15 mile radius of the University of Tennessee. I've been playing sports since I was six years old, which was a crucial part of my childhood and helped me become who I am today. I'm also a very competitive person. This helped bring a sense of selflessness at a very young age because I was willing to sacrifice anything to win games and reach my desired and result this sense of selflessness would help me in the future. When I became more interested in service clubs, my interest in entering the service groups only increases I would throughout school, by my senior in high school. This interest had turned into passion. I was involved with five service clubs within my school as well as to other in the community. I received most school service principles award, a service to humanities award and other recognitions given to me by my school as well as my community for my efforts and passion in school and community service. Lastly, I would like to share my plans for the future. I'm a history major with a minor and secondary education. I plan on becoming a history teacher and participating in the teachers for America program, which combines my love of history teaching and helping others. My end goal, however, is to become a high school principal in this position, I would love to remain heavily involved with student life. So today I've shared with you a little bit more about myself, my interest and hobbies and finally, my plans for the future.

My name is Kirsten Freeman. I'm originally from Denver colorado but was raised right here in Knoxville Tennessee. Today I'll be sharing a little bit more about my background, my interest in the holidays and my plans for the future. As I mentioned before, I was raised in Knoxville. My elementary middle and high school are all within a 15 mile radius of the University of Tennessee. I've been playing sports since I was six years old, which was a crucial part of my childhood and helped me become who I am today. I'm also a very competitive person. This helped bring a sense of selflessness at a very young age because I was willing to sacrifice anything to win games and reach my desired and result this sense of selflessness would help me in the future. When I became more interested in service clubs, my interest in entering the service groups only increases I would throughout school, by my senior in high school. This interest had turned into passion. I was involved with five service clubs within my school as well as to other in the community. I received most school service principles award, a service to humanities award and other recognitions given to me by my school as well as my community for my efforts and passion in school and community service. Lastly, I would like to share my plans for the future. I'm a history major with a minor and secondary education. I plan on becoming a history teacher and participating in the teachers for America program, which combines my love of history teaching and helping others. My end goal, however, is to become a high school principal in this position, I would love to remain heavily involved with student life. So today I've shared with you a little bit more about myself, my interest and hobbies and finally, my plans for the future.
